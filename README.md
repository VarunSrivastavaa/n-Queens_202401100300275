N-QUEENS PROBLEM

N-Queens is an important and traditional problem of computer science and artificial intelligence, more precisely combinatorial optimization and constraint satisfaction. The task is to put N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens can attack each other according to the chess queen's move rules. A queen can travel any number of squares in any horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction, i.e., potentially attack any other queen that lies in the same row, column, or diagonal. The problem is interesting and challenging because it is a question of determining a configuration where such attack possibilities do not exist. It poses problems to a variety of algorithmic methods, including backtracking, constraint satisfaction, and heuristics. Furthermore, as N increases, the problem becomes more difficult, making it therefore a perfect problem to use in investigating search and optimization techniques in AI and computer science.
